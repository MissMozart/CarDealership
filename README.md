# CarDealership

This program lets the user search vehicles by different attributes, 
add and remove vehicles to and from a document and lease or buy a vehicle. 

## Overview

The project contains nine classes and two documents. One document is the inventory of vehicles, 
the other document is for saving the lease and sale contracts.
